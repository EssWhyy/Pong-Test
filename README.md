## Pong Test

### Made using Pygame module in Python 3. The classic bounce-a-ball-with-your-bat-and-try-to get-past-your opponent game.

##### Includes many features similar to that of the original 1972 version including:
- Ball bouncing Idle Screen/Win Screen
- Delay between each ball regen and screen transition 
- Basic ball bounce mechanics
- No pause button (because they didnâ€™t exist in 1972!)

Meant for entertainment purposes. For the record, this is my first real program that I coded, so feel free to make comments/improvements

##### Potential Improvements:

- Find a way to allow bat to move while delay is implemented.
-	Implement better ball bounce mechanics (tweak angle of ball bounce depending on the part of the bat which hits,
-	Other features like additional bats/balls?

##### Necessities:
- Pygame can be installed via command line, pip install pygame 
- Font pack attached with the game is optional.
